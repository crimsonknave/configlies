After pulling down the repo you will need to run :

git submodule update --init

that will pull down vundle.

Then, inside vim run :BundleInstall and it will pull down all the plugins and manage them.

You will then want to pull down oh-my-zsh (and checkout .zshrc again)


Then, run 

fc-cache -vf

that will regenerate the font cache (one of the submodules is a font for powerline).

Then set your terminal font to be Ubuntu Mono powerline (or whatever the name is)

After that you should open up vim and run :BundleInstall (ignore the errors about not finding colorschemes, that's what we are doing right now)

To setup Command-T you will need to change into ~/.vim/bundle/Command-T/ruby/command-t and run ruby extconf.rb

You will also want to intall oh-my-zsh
