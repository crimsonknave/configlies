After pulling down the repo you will need to run :

git submodule update --init

that will pull down vundle.

Then, inside vim run :BundleInstall and it will pull down all the plugins and manage them.


Then, run 

fc-cache -vf

that will regenerate the font cache (one of the submodules is a font for powerline).

Then set your terminal font to be Ubuntu Mono powerline (or whatever the name is)
